##  Where to start ?

- Read the reports on pCloud (.html and .pdf files at the root of "Nicolas" folder)
- Look at the output subfolder, in particuler the "Carte_donnees_mal_classees..." files, which are a prefiguration of what the project output could be.
- Look at the data, in particular the "reformated" version of InFloris database (in pCloud, subfolder databases/InFloris)

- Clone this git project
- Install python 3.12
- set up your virtual environment using the requirements.txt file
- start looking at the scripts: 
    * main statistical modeling script: ./nf_src/statistical_modeling_main.py
    * its parameters file (an application of it may be found in pcloud, experiments/ folder): input\parameters_template.yml
    * analysis scripts in ./nf_src/model_analysis/

CAUTION: the input files should be changed with appropriate pathes to be able to run the scripts (paths are absolute... sorry about that). In addition, I did not test the scripts since... 2024. I'll do it in the following days.
